This is the API Reference for the Next.js x Quirrel client.

Install it by running `npm install @quirrel/next`.

## `Queue`

```ts
function Queue<T>(
    path: string,
    worker: (job: T): Promise<void>,
    queueOptions?: { exclusive?: boolean }
): QueueInstance<T>
```

Creates a new Queue.
Make sure to export it from an [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), otherwise it won't work.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Usage                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`         | The queue's path. `queues/email` if reachable under `api/queues/email`.     |
| `worker`       | a function that takes the job's payload and returns a `Promise`             |
| `queueOptions` | Optional. Use the `exclusive` flag to limit this Queue to serial execution. |


### `.enqueue`

```ts
async enqueue(
    payload: T,
    options: {
        id?: string;
        override?: boolean;

        runAt?: Date;
        delay?: number | string;
        repeat?: {
            every?: number | string;
            times?: number;
            cron?: string;
        }

        exclusive?: boolean;
    }
): Promise<Job<T>>
```

Enqueues a new Job and returns it.

#### Schedule for a specified date

```ts
birthdayQueue.enqueue(
    user.id,
    {
        runAt: user.birthday
    }
);
```

#### Delay by a week

```ts
welcomeUserQueue.enqueue(
    user.id,
    {
        delay: "7d" // same as 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
    }
);
```

#### Repeated job

```ts
todoReminders.enqueue(
    todo.id,
    {
        runAt: todo.scheduled_date,
        id: todo.id,
        repeat: {
            every: "1d",
            times: 3
        }
    }
);
```

Runs three times: At `scheduled_date`, one day later and two days later.

#### CRON Job

```ts
billingQueue.enqueue(
    undefined,
    {
        id: "billing", // makes sure job isn't duplicated
        override: true, // if another job with that ID already exists, override it
        repeat: {
            cron: "* * * * 1 *"
        }
    }
);
```

CRON jobs are scheduled based on UTC.

#### Order Queue

```ts
orderQueue.enqueue(
    { ... },
    {
        id: "1234", // if two jobs share the same `runAt`, they're ordered by ID.
        exclusive: true, // make sure only one job is executed at once
    }
);
```

You can also specify `{ exclusive: true }` as the third argument to the `Queue` constructor.

### `.get`

```ts
*get(): AsyncIterator< Job<T>[] >
```

A generator function that can be used to iterate over pending jobs:

```ts
for await (const jobs of queue.get()) {
    // do something
}
```

### `.getById`

```ts
getById(id: string): Promise<Job<T> | null>
```

Returns a job's representation, if it exists.

### `.invoke`

```ts
invoke(id: string): Promise<Job<T> | null>
```

Gets a job and invokes it, if it exists.
Returns the job's representation.

### `.delete`

```ts
delete(id: string): Promise<Job<T> | null>
```

Gets a job and deletes it, if it exists.
Returns the job's representation.

## `Job`

A representation of a pending job.
Can be retrieved using `Queue` methods.

### `id`

```ts
id: string
```

The job's `id`.
If not specified during `.enqueue`, it's a random UUID generated by Quirrel.

### `endpoint`

```ts
endpoint: string
```

The HTTP endpoint the job will be executed against.
Is always the same.

### `body`

```ts
body: T
```

The job's payload.

### `runAt`

```ts
runAt: Date
```

The date the job is scheduled for.

### `repeat`

```ts
{
    cron?: string;
    times?: number;
    every?: number;
    count: number;
}
```

Repetition options of the job.
`count` starts at `1` and is incremented with every execution.

### `exclusive`

```ts
exclusive: boolean
```

If a job is marked as `exclusive`, that means there won't be any other job executed at the same time.
If applied to all jobs in a queue, that effectively guarantees serial execution.

### `.invoke`

```ts
invoke(): Promise<Job | null>
```

Invokes the job and returns it.
Returns `null` if it's already been executed / deleted.

### `.delete`

```ts
delete(): Promise<Job | null>
```

Deletes the job and returns it.
Returns `null` if it's already been deleted / executed.
