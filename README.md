# Quirrel

The Task Queueing Solution for Next.js x Vercel.

This repository contains the Quirrel backend. It's a job scheduler similar to [repeater.dev](https://repeater.dev) or [Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/), but written in TypeScript and with the option to self-host.

Visit https://api.quirrel.dev/documentation to find out about available endpoints.
